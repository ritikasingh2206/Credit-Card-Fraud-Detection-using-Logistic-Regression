# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using logistic regression. The dataset contains transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these transactions.

## Project Overview

- **Data Analysis:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize the data to gain insights into the distribution of transaction amounts and class balance.
- **Data Sampling:** Handle class imbalance by creating a balanced sample dataset.
- **Model Building:** Build a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters for better performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`

## Results

- Achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall in fraud detection.
- Successfully handled class imbalance and fine-tuned the model for better performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression in fraud detection and highlights the importance of data analysis and model evaluation in building effective fraud detection systems.
